        Paul Darey was born in Buenos Aires, Argentina in 1977 and moved to Barcelona in 1988.
        In the early nineties he became influenced by electronic music, and started playing nightly in a small club in Barcelona called Jerba. By the late nineties he had been massively influenced by the House music that was hitting the Spanish club scene at that time and became a regular in many of Barcelona’s top clubs.
